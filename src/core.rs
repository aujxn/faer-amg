    /// Block size specifies the size of dense blocks in the matrix. It's not required that all
    /// values in a dense block are non-zero in the sparsity pattern of the compressed matrix but
    /// only square blocks are allowed and the matrix dimensions must be an even multiple of block
    /// size. Dense blocks are considered indivisible units in algorithms:
    /// - coarsening algorithms will only aggregate entire blocks
    /// - smoothers and matrix manipulations operate on block scale
    ///
    /// It's intended for relatively small blocks with intuition related to the underlying problem
    /// associated with the matrix operator. Examples:
    /// - matrices from a 3d PDE discretization where the solution is in the form of displacement
    /// (such as elasticity), then the natural block size is 3
    /// - for systems of PDEs with multiple unknown values the block size could be the number of
    /// unknowns
    ///
    /// NOTE that this only works if your matrix is actually ordered correctly... for the first
    /// example the matrix degrees of freedom should be ordered `x_1, y_1, z_1, ..., x_n, y_n,
    /// z_n`.
    ///
    /// The `par` argument makes an optimized operator for the parallel application of the
    /// operator. Providing more than 1 thread here will double the memory required and creates an
    /// entire copy of the matrix broken into pieces to be consumed by each thread. Dropping all
    /// copies of this object once a preconditioner is constructed should free this memory because
    /// the final preconditioner objects only maintain references to the parallel operator when
    /// provided, but this is cloned in multiple configurations and intermediate algorithm structs
    /// such as `Hierarchy` and `Partitioner` which also must be dropped if memory is limited.
    /// Currently, there is no default parallel implementation of SpMM in `faer`, partly
    /// because the performance of such an implementation and the best algorithm is highly
    /// dependent on the structure of the matrix. This implementation is under assumptions
    /// reasonable to mesh based PDE discretizations:
    /// - `nnz` per row is bounded and generally consistent
    /// - many values are clustered near the diagonal
    ///
    /// Violating these assumptions is fine but might result in suboptimal performance. If
    /// the matrix `nnz` per row is extremely unbalanced, construction of the parallel operator will
    /// panic. For this to happen most of the nonzero values have to be contained in less rows
    /// than the number of parallelism threads.
